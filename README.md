# Dogethereum
Sending Dogecoins safely from the Doge coin proper blockchain to an Ethereum coin contract and back. 

Presently the project is exploring two methodologies of created Ethereum coin contract side chains.

1. Validation sidechains via either OpCode extensions or duel-full client authentication.
2. Bonded Sidechains via entry and exit address incentivizations, secured with Ethereum based securities.
